      Food is something that is integral to our lives as human beings; we rely on it for sustenance – we need it for life. The act of eating food is one that can be experienced in most settings, whether that be at a diner, a three-Michelin star restaurant, in a park, or on an airplane. Each of these separate spaces where people eat has a distinct aural atmosphere; for example, kids shouting, soda cans popping, and burgers hissing on a grill are all sonic characteristics of a Fourth of July barbeque that you would be very unlikely to experience in a library at midnight. I am curious to investigate how sounds <b>we hear while we eat affect the taste of our food</b>, and how the <b>psychoacoustics behind this taste-altering phenomenon</b> is being applied in commercial dining experiences.
    </p>

    </p>
      Psychoacoustics, or “the branch of psychology concerned with the perception of sound and its physiological effects” ties heavily into this discussion (Merriam-Webster). The characteristics of sound – specifically, the volume and the pitch – have psychological effects on us that can enhance or detract from the five tastes we can experience: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami. In fact, environments with loud noises can increase the intensity of sweetness, and can make umami tastes more pronounced. Yet at the same time, they tend to slightly decrease the saltiness, sourness, and bitterness of foods. 
    </p>

    </p>
      I would like to investigate this topic to be able to form sound theories (backed by research) about how eateries take these psychoacoustic phenomena to determine what sounds they incorporate into their dining experiences. That could be shown in the music they play or the location and configuration of seating (tables spread apart on an oceanfront versus barstools cramped in a loud, indoor area). In fact, there has been research done regarding how managers of restaurants use what is called "sonic seasoning," to determine how they modulate the noise levels and music they play to stimulate certain gustatory elements of a dish.
