      <i>
        types of tastes we can sense:
      </i>
      <ul>
        <li>Sweet - “having the pleasant taste characteristic of sugar or honey; not salty, sour, or bitter.”</li>
        <li>Salty - “tasting of, containing, or preserved with salt.”</li>
        <li>Sour - “having an acid taste like lemon or vinegar.”</li>
        <li>Bitter - “having a sharp, pungent taste or smell; not sweet.”</li>
        <li>Umami - “a strong meaty taste imparted by glutamate and certain other amino acid”</li>

          in hearing the taste of food 
        </i> 
        <br>An experiment published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance involved researchers experimenting with the five tastes, all at different concentrations with either <i>normal ambient noise</i> or <i>simulated loud airplane cabin noise. </i>Researchers had 48 men and women try liquid solutions of five different tastes and found that there were <i>no significant differences</i> in how the people rated the salty, sour or bitter tastes, and in the loud noise environment, <i>sweet taste intensity was rated as lower and umami taste was rated as more pronounced</i><br>

        <i> 
          and "sonic seasoning"
        </i>
       <p>
        Sonic Seasoning is another application of how we can change the sounds being listened to enhance or suppress certain flavor elements. Aside from varying amplitudes to increase or decrease volume, we can change the pitch of sounds we listen to to do the same task. High-frequency sounds enhance the sweetness in food, while low frequencies bring out the bitterness. The subtleties are brought out of the food, yet the flavor of the food remains the same. It is just the way its taste is perceived is different so as to magnify. The sound is known as “modulating taste.”
      </p>
       <p>
        The applications of this are wide and varied, but one of the most direct is developing food that is better suited for eating environments with lots of noise, (including airplanes) but also  bars and diners, for example. Enhancing the umami flavor of foods can make foods more appealing in environments like this, which is probably one of the reasons whymany people choose to drink tomato juice, a naturally umami food, on airplanes. As (researcher) says, "If he proves his hypothesis, perhaps concentrating on umami-rich ingredients such as tomatoes, parmesan, mushrooms and cured meats in the sky could help obliterate plane-food hell"
